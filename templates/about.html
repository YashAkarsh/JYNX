        <h2> What's JYNX?</h2>

        <blockquote>It's a whole new perspective on anonymity. We think anonymity should be an enjoyable and secure platform where you can freely express your thoughts and emotions without any embarrassment. Nowadays,  individuals lack a space where they can openly share their feelings without being judged by their peers or societal expectations. JYNX offers a safe haven for people to do just that.

           <h3>Introduction üëã</h3>
           JYNX is a platform where individuals can freely express themselves and connect with their own audience. We have established guidelines to ensure the safety and enjoyment of all JYNX users. Please read our complete Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, as these guidelines are only a summary and not a replacement for the full terms.

            <li> Create Your Cards (Zigs):&nbsp;&nbsp;
            You will be responsible for crafting zigs, which are cards designed to facilitate open discussions about yourself or any topic of interest. These zigs will serve as a platform for your friends and the wider world to share their genuine opinions.</li>

            <li>Be REAL:&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Make sure to give complete, accurate, and up-to-date information when creating an account on JYNX! To ensure the best website experience for you and the JYNX community, it is important to be honest and genuine while using the website.

            In the end, JYNX was created because we truly believe that Gen-Z should have a platform where they can freely express their genuine thoughts, emotions, and feelings without worrying about bullying, criticism, or societal expectations. However, it's important to remember that anonymity also comes with a sense of responsibility. So, let's always be respectful and treat others the way we want to be treated.
